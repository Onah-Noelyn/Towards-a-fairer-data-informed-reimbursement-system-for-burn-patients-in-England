## Abstract
We use quantitative data from burn patients in England to investigate whether a data-driven approach can lead to a fairer reimbursement system compared to the current expert-generated rule-based approach, also known as Health Resource Groups (HRGs). Currently, HRGs aim to group and calculate treatment costs of patients similar in terms of clinical characteristics and resource usage. However, research has shown that HRGs are insufficiently homogeneous in clinical characteristics and resource usage, especially for patients treated in highly specialised services, leading to an inequitable reimbursement of funds. Our analysis comprises a machine learning approach, and the results confirm that the proposed approach identifies groups with increased homogeneity compared to the current HRG groups. This implies that burn patients with, for example, similar injury profiles and an expected low cost of treatment are appropriately identified as members of the same group, allowing for the equal reimbursement of treatment costs regardless of the burn service attended. Our results show that the efficient utilisation of data, augmented with expert advice, can improve the reimbursement system to ensure an equitable and fair distribution of funds.
